Slicer plugin offers useful features that OctoPrint's built-in slicer doesn't have:

- Rotate, scale, and move STL models.
- Slice multiple STLs at a time.
- Auto-arrange models into optimized layout (experimental).
- Slice based on Cura profiles you upload to OctoPrint.
- Customizable slicing settings, including Basic (layer height, bed temperature ...) and Advanced (print speed, start/end G-code ...).
- More is coming...
